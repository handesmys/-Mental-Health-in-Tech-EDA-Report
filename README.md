# 🧠-Mental-Health-in-Tech-EDA-Report

###

📄 PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project explores the mental health landscape among tech industry employees using a publicly available survey dataset. The analysis focuses on how factors like employer support, company type, remote work, gender, and perceived stigma influence mental health treatment.

🔍 KEY FINDINGS

Demographics & Treatment:

· Respondents aged 26–35 are the most likely to seek mental health treatment.

· Female respondents and those with a family history of mental illness are more likely to report receiving treatment.

Work Interference:
  
· Nearly half of respondents stated that mental health "sometimes" interferes with work.

· Higher levels of interference correlate with higher treatment rates.

Employer Support:

·Tech companies are more likely to offer mental health benefits, care options, and resources to seek help.

·However, a significant portion of employees—even in tech—are unaware of available support, limiting its effectiveness.

Stigma & Disclosure:

·Respondents are significantly more concerned about disclosing mental health issues compared to physical ones.

·Many fear negative consequences during interviews or at work, which aligns with observed cases of workplace discrimination.

Remote Work & Leave:

· A majority do not work remotely, but remote work does not show a strong correlation with treatment.

· Mental health leave policies are often unclear, with 45% of respondents saying they don’t know how easy it is to take leave for mental health reasons.

Treatment vs Employer Support:

· A heatmap analysis shows that respondents who received treatment are more concentrated in combinations where their employers provide clear, visible support (benefits, care options, and seek help resources).
